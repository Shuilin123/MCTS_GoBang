# MCTS_GoBang
This is a Qt-based Monte Carlo search based AI Gobang project 
## __MCTS_GoBang-C++__ : _Qt-based Monte Carlo search-based AI Gobang_
### Introduction
This project is based on Qt software development platform development based on Monte Carlo tree search of Gobang AI code, including gobang model data structure, GUI interface material, core AI algorithm and so on. This project is suitable for c++ language teaching, and the game theory course is used as an example program.  
### Requirements  
The main package and version of the c++ environment are as follows
```
# Name                    Version         
c++                        2011
Qt                          5.11
```  
The above environment is successful when running the code of the project. In addition, it is well known that c++ has very good compatibility (version>=11). Thus, __I suggest you try to use the existing c++ environment firstly.__
